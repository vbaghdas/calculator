# CALCULATOR

## Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap

#### Description

This calculator was developed using bootstrap for a mobile responsive experience.
For every button(number or operator) pressed, the value is appended to an equation inside of an array and displayed on the calculator screen using jQuery which is later used in a math function using JS to generate the output. The application also has keyboard support through your keyboard numpad.

The calculator is capable of handling a multiple set of operations including but not limited to:

##### BASIC OPERATIONS
+ addition	1 + 2 =	3	
+ multiplication	1 * 2 =	2	
+ division	1 / 2 =	0.5	
+ subtraction	1 - 2 = -1

##### COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS			
+ successive operation	1 + 1 + 2 =	4	
+ decimals	1 . 1 + 1 . 1 =	2.2	
+ multiple decimals	1 ... 1 + 1 ... 1 =	2.2	
+ multiple operation keys	1 ++++ 2 =	3	
+ changing operation keys	1 + - * 2 =	2
+ operation rollover	1 + 1 + = + = 8
+ operation repeat 1 + 1 = = = 4		
+ division by zero	1 / 0 = "Error"	

##### ADVANCED OPERATIONS			
+ premature operation	++++ 1 * 3 = 3		
+ partial operand	3 *	= 9
+ missing operation	3 =	3	
+ missing operands	= = = =	0	

##### EXTRA OPERATIONS			
+ func. calculator: order of ops	1 + 3 / 4 + 10 * 2	21.75
